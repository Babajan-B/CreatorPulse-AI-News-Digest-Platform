# CreatorPulse - Project Development Writeup

**Assignment:** 100xEngineers LLM Module  
**Project Duration:** October 2025  
**Presented By:** [Your Name]

## Introduction

Hi everyone, today I'm going to walk you through CreatorPulse, an AI-powered news intelligence platform I built as part of the 100xEngineers LLM Module assignment. Let me take you through the entire journey - from understanding the problem to deploying a fully functional platform.

---

## 1. Understanding the Problem Statement

So first, let me talk about the problem I was solving. The assignment presented a real challenge that content creators face every single day:

**The Core Problem:**
Content creators and newsletter writers lose 3-5 hours daily manually researching and curating content. This time drain slows down their consistency and limits their reach.

When I broke this down, I identified four key pain points:

**First**, there's information overload. Imagine trying to scan through 50+ news sources and reading 100+ articles every day just to find the best content. That's 2-3 hours gone right there.

**Second**, there's content curation fatigue. After finding articles, you have to manually select them, read each one carefully, take notes, and summarize the key points. That's another hour or more.

**Third**, there's the actual writing time. Crafting a newsletter with a consistent voice, writing engaging intros and closings, adding commentary - that takes 45-60 minutes minimum.

**Fourth**, there's trend discovery. How do you know what's actually trending right now? You'd have to manually check Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter, and other platforms. That's time-consuming and you'll probably miss important discussions anyway.

So I set out to solve this with three main objectives:
1. Automate source aggregation completely
2. Surface emerging trends automatically  
3. Streamline content packaging to be 70%+ ready to send

The target? Reduce that 3-5 hour workflow down to under 20 minutes.

## 2. Database Architecture - Starting with Supabase

Once I understood the problem, I knew I needed a solid database foundation. I chose Supabase because it gives me PostgreSQL - a powerful relational database - with a fantastic developer experience and built-in authentication support.

Here's how I approached the database design:

### Step 1: Identifying Core Entities

I started by mapping out what data I needed to store:
- **Articles** - The news content itself
- **Users** - People using the platform
- **Digests** - Generated newsletters
- **Analytics** - Email engagement tracking
- **Voice Training** - Writing style samples
- **Trends** - Detected trending topics

### Step 2: Schema Design

I created a comprehensive schema with 10 main tables. Let me walk through the key ones:

**Articles Table (`feed_items`):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE feed_items (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  summary TEXT,
  url TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  source_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  published_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  quality_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 5.0,
  tags TEXT[],
  image_url TEXT,
  ...
);
```

This stores every article with a quality score, tags for filtering, and timestamps for recency tracking.

**Users & Settings Tables:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  ...
);

CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  preferred_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'ai_news',
  digest_time TEXT DEFAULT '09:00',
  timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC',
  auto_send BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  ...
);
```

This handles authentication and user preferences - like when they want their digest delivered and whether they prefer AI news or science content.

**Analytics Tables:**
I built comprehensive tracking with `delivery_logs` and `engagement_analytics` tables to track every email sent, opened, and clicked. This data powers the ROI calculator.

### Step 3: Indexing Strategy

Performance was crucial, so I added strategic indexes:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_published_at ON feed_items(published_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_quality_score ON feed_items(quality_score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_tags ON feed_items USING GIN(tags);
```

This ensures fast queries when sorting by date or filtering by quality score.

## 3. Frontend Development - Building the User Experience

With the database ready, I moved to the frontend. I wanted something modern, fast, and beautiful.

### Technology Choices

I went with **Next.js 15** using the App Router because it gives me:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- API routes for backend logic
- Built-in optimization
- Great developer experience

For styling, I chose **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui components**. This gave me a professional design system right out of the box with components like cards, buttons, dialogs, and more.

### Page Structure

I built several key pages:

**Main Dashboard (`app/page.tsx`):**
This is where users land. It shows 50+ curated AI articles with:
- Quality scores displayed as stars
- Topic filtering with 10+ categories
- AI-powered search
- Beautiful card-based layout
- Dark/light mode support

**Science Dashboard (`app/science/page.tsx`):**
A parallel track for scientific research news with:
- Research papers from Nature, Science, PLOS
- Impact scores instead of quality scores
- Category badges (medical, physics, neuroscience)
- Same professional design

**Analytics Dashboard (`app/analytics/page.tsx`):**
This is where the ROI magic happens. Users can see:
- Email open rates and CTR
- Top performing articles
- Source performance metrics
- Time savings calculations with customizable hourly rate

**Draft Management (`app/drafts/`):**
A complete newsletter editor with:
- List of all generated drafts
- Draft detail view with edit capabilities
- Preview and edit modes
- Approve and send functionality

### Component Architecture

I created reusable components:
- **NewsCard** - Displays articles with sharing options
- **StatsDashboard** - Shows key metrics
- **TopicFilter** - Tag-based filtering
- **TrendingTopics** - Social media trends carousel
- **VoiceModelDialog** - Choose AI style for content generation

Everything is responsive - works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 4. Backend Development - The Brain of the Operation

The backend is where most of the magic happens. Let me walk through the key services I built:

### API Routes Architecture

I structured the API into logical endpoints:

**Authentication (`app/api/auth/`):**
- `/api/auth/signup` - User registration with bcrypt password hashing
- `/api/auth/login` - JWT token generation with 7-day expiration
- `/api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `/api/auth/logout` - Session cleanup

I used **httpOnly cookies** for security - the JWT token is stored in a cookie that JavaScript can't access, protecting against XSS attacks.

**Articles API (`app/api/articles/`):**
This endpoint fetches and caches articles. Here's what's clever about it:
- First checks Supabase cache (if requested)
- Falls back to live RSS fetch if needed
- Filters to last 7 days only for fresh content
- Sorts by quality score and recency
- Saves to database asynchronously

**Drafts API (`app/api/drafts/`):**
The newsletter generation system with full CRUD:
- `GET /api/drafts` - List user's drafts
- `POST /api/drafts` - Generate new draft with AI
- `GET /api/drafts/[id]` - View specific draft
- `PUT /api/drafts/[id]` - Update draft content
- `POST /api/drafts/[id]/approve` - Approve and send via email

### Core Services

**Voice Training Service (`lib/voice-trainer.ts`):**
This analyzes writing samples to create a voice profile. It extracts:
- Average sentence length
- Paragraph structure
- Tone markers (formal/casual)
- Common phrases and vocabulary
- Punctuation patterns

**Voice Matching Service (`lib/voice-matcher.ts`):**
Uses the voice profile to generate content that sounds like you. It builds detailed prompts for the LLM that include your writing characteristics.

**Trend Detection Service (`lib/trend-detection-service.ts`):**
Implements TF-IDF algorithm to detect trending topics. It tracks keyword frequency over time and identifies spikes that indicate emerging trends.

---

## 5. RSS Feed Integration - Content Aggregation

Now let me talk about how I aggregate content from 38+ sources.

### Feed Selection Strategy

I carefully selected premium sources in two categories:

**AI News Sources (19 feeds):**
- Research institutions: MIT, Stanford, Berkeley
- Companies: OpenAI, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, NVIDIA
- Publications: TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired
- Technical blogs: Towards Data Science, Papers with Code

**Science Breakthrough Sources (19 feeds):**
- Journals: Nature, Science, Cell, The Lancet
- Research: PLOS, PNAS, NIH, CDC
- News: Science Daily, Phys.org, Medical Xpress

### RSS Parser Implementation (`lib/rss-parser.ts`)

I built a robust RSS parser that:

**Fetches in parallel** with 10-second timeouts per feed:
```typescript
const fetchPromises = sources.map(source => 
  Promise.race([
    parseRSSFeed(source.url, source.name),
    timeout(10000)
  ])
);
```

**Calculates quality scores** based on multiple factors:
- Source reputation: Premium sources get +2.0 points
- Recency: Articles <24 hours get +1.5 points
- Content depth: Longer articles get up to +1.0
- Media quality: Articles with images get +0.5

**Filters for freshness:**
Only articles from the last 7 days are shown. This was crucial because I found old articles were diluting the content quality.

**Extracts metadata:**
- Images from multiple RSS fields
- Tags from categories
- Author information
- Publication dates

### Social Media Integration

Beyond RSS, I integrated 5 social platforms:

**Reddit (`lib/reddit-service.ts`):**
- Fetches from r/artificial and r/OpenAI
- Caches for 2 hours to avoid API limits
- Filters to last 48 hours for true trending

**Tech Communities:**
- Hacker News via Firebase API
- Lobsters via RSS
- Slashdot via RSS  
- Product Hunt via RSS

The social integration detects trending topics using engagement metrics - upvotes, comments, and recency.

## 6. Groq API Integration - AI-Powered Intelligence

This is where the AI magic happens. I integrated Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model for lightning-fast AI processing.

### Why Groq?

I chose Groq because:
- Ultra-fast inference: 1-2 seconds per article
- High quality: Llama 3.3 70B is powerful
- Generous free tier: 14,400 requests/day
- Simple SDK: Easy to integrate

### LLM Service (`lib/llm-service.ts`)

I created a service that uses structured prompts for different tasks:

**Article Summarization:**
```typescript
const prompt = `
Summarize this AI news article in 2-3 clear sentences.
Focus on key developments and implications.

Title: ${article.title}
Content: ${article.content}

Output as JSON:
{
  "summary": "...",
  "bullet_points": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "hashtags": ["#AI", "#MachineLearning", ...]
}
`;
```

The AI returns structured JSON that I can directly use in emails and UI.

**Voice-Matched Content Generation:**
For newsletter drafts, I built sophisticated prompts that include:
- User's voice characteristics (sentence length, tone, vocabulary)
- Example writing samples
- Specific instructions for intro/closing/commentary
- Mode context (AI news vs Science)

The result? Content that's 70%+ ready to send with minimal editing.

### Mode-Specific Prompts

I learned early on that generic prompts produce generic content. So I made prompts mode-aware:

**AI News Mode:**
```
"Write an AI NEWS newsletter introduction focusing on:
AI developments, GPT models, LLMs, machine learning...
Do NOT write about genetics unless it's in today's topics."
```

**Science Mode:**
```
"Write a SCIENCE newsletter introduction focusing on:
Medical research, physics, biology, breakthroughs...
Focus on scientific discoveries and their implications."
```

This ensures the content stays on topic.

---

## 7. Email Integration - MailerSend Implementation

Email delivery needed to be beautiful and reliable. I chose MailerSend.

### Email Service (`lib/email-service.ts`)

I built a wrapper around MailerSend's SDK that:

**Handles authentication:**
```typescript
const mailerSend = new MailerSend({
  apiKey: process.env.MAILERSEND_API_KEY
});
```

**Manages trial account limitations:**
Trial accounts can only send to admin email, so I built logic to handle this gracefully with clear subject line notes.

**Converts HTML to plain text:**
For email clients that don't support HTML, I strip tags automatically.

### Email Templates (`lib/email-templates.ts`)

I designed three beautiful email templates:

**Daily Digest Template:**
- Gradient header with mode-specific colors (purple for AI, green for Science)
- Personalized greeting
- Each article gets its own styled card
- AI summaries highlighted
- Bullet points for quick scanning
- Read more buttons with brand styling

**Newsletter Draft Template:**
- Custom introduction from AI
- Trending topics section
- Multiple articles with commentary
- Personal closing message
- Professional footer

**Single Article Template:**
- Focus on one article
- Enhanced AI summary
- Full summary text
- Large call-to-action button

All templates are:
- Responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Professional design
- Brand-consistent
- Email client compatible

---

## 8. Content Creation Features - The Innovation

This is where CreatorPulse really shines. Let me walk through the content creation pipeline:

### Voice Training System

**The Challenge:**
How do you make AI-generated content sound like a specific person?

**My Solution:**
I built a voice training system that analyzes writing samples:

**Step 1: Sample Analysis (`lib/voice-trainer.ts`)**
Users upload 20+ past newsletters. The system analyzes:
- Sentence length distribution
- Vocabulary complexity using Flesch-Kincaid scoring
- Tone markers (formal vs casual language)
- Punctuation patterns
- Common phrases and transitions
- Structural preferences (lists vs paragraphs)

**Step 2: Profile Creation**
All this analysis creates a "voice profile":
```typescript
{
  avgSentenceLength: 18.5,
  toneMarkers: ["conversational", "professional"],
  commonPhrases: ["Let's dive in", "Here's the thing"],
  punctuationStyle: {
    exclamation: 0.12,  // 12% of sentences
    question: 0.08
  },
  ...
}
```

**Step 3: Content Generation (`lib/voice-matcher.ts`)**
When generating content, I build prompts that include:
- The voice profile characteristics
- 3 example writing samples
- Specific instructions to match the style
- Target word count and structure

The LLM then generates content that matches the user's writing style with 70%+ accuracy.

### Draft Generation System

**The Workflow:**

1. **Article Selection:**
   - Fetches top-quality articles from last 24 hours
   - Or uses user-specified articles
   - Limits to 5-10 for optimal digest length

2. **Trend Detection:**
   - Scans social media for trending topics
   - Uses TF-IDF to find keyword spikes
   - Selects top 3 trends with explanations

3. **Content Generation:**
   - AI writes introduction (100-150 words) in user's voice
   - AI adds commentary to each article
   - AI generates closing (50-100 words)
   - Everything maintains consistent voice

4. **Draft Assembly:**
   - Combines all sections into structured newsletter
   - Saves as "pending" status
   - Ready for review

The entire generation process takes 10-15 seconds.

---

## 9. Additional Features I Implemented

Beyond the core requirements, I added several powerful features:

### Dual-Mode System

I realized different users want different content, so I built dual-mode support:

**AI News Mode:**
- 19 AI-focused RSS feeds
- GPT, LLMs, machine learning topics
- Trending from AI subreddits
- Purple/blue brand colors

**Science Breakthrough Mode:**
- 19 scientific journal feeds
- Medical, physics, biology topics
- Science-focused trending
- Green/teal brand colors

Users can switch modes or set their preference in settings.

### Quality Scoring Algorithm

I developed a multi-factor scoring system (0-10 scale):

```
Score = Base (5.0) 
      + Source Reputation (0-2.0)
      + Recency (0-1.5)
      + Content Depth (0-1.0)
      + Media Quality (0-0.5)
```

This ensures only high-quality content surfaces. Articles scoring below 6.0 are filtered out.

### Real-Time Trend Detection

I implemented spike detection for trending topics:

1. **Fetch** posts from Reddit, Hacker News, etc.
2. **Extract** keywords using NLP (compromise.js)
3. **Calculate** TF-IDF scores
4. **Detect** volume spikes (2x baseline = trending)
5. **Rank** by engagement and recency

Trends are cached for 2 hours and displayed prominently on the dashboard.

### Analytics & ROI Tracking

I built a comprehensive analytics system that tracks:

**Email Metrics:**
- Total sent, delivered, opened, clicked
- Open rate (target: 35%+)
- Click-through rate (target: 8%+)
- Bounce tracking

**Performance Metrics:**
- Top 10 most clicked articles
- Source performance rankings
- Engagement trends over time

**ROI Calculator:**
Here's the coolest part - I calculate actual monetary value:
```
Time Saved = (Manual Time - Review Time) × Frequency
Monetary Value = Time Saved × Hourly Rate

Example: 
210 min/day × 30 days = 105 hrs/month
105 hrs × $50/hr = $5,250/month saved
```

This proves the platform's value with hard numbers.

### Search & Filtering

I implemented:
- AI-powered semantic search
- 10+ topic filters (Machine Learning, GPT Models, AI Ethics, etc.)
- Multi-select filtering
- Real-time results

## 10. Technical Implementation Highlights

Let me share some interesting technical challenges I solved:

### Challenge 1: Authentication with httpOnly Cookies

**Problem:** I needed secure authentication that works with Next.js API routes.

**Solution:** I implemented JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies:
```typescript
// Generate JWT on login
const token = await new SignJWT({ userId, email })
  .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
  .setExpirationTime('7d')
  .sign(JWT_SECRET);

// Store in httpOnly cookie
response.cookies.set('auth-token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,  // JavaScript can't access
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7  // 7 days
});
```

Then in API routes, I verify the token from cookies:
```typescript
const token = request.cookies.get('auth-token')?.value;
const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWT_SECRET);
```

This is secure against XSS attacks and works seamlessly.

### Challenge 2: Date Filtering for Fresh Content

**Problem:** Initially, articles from 2 months ago were showing up, making the content feel stale.

**Solution:** I implemented aggressive date filtering:
```typescript
// Articles: Last 7 days only
const sevenDaysAgo = new Date();
sevenDaysAgo.setDate(sevenDaysAgo.getDate() - 7);

const recentArticles = allArticles.filter(article => {
  const publishedDate = new Date(article.publishedAt);
  return publishedDate >= sevenDaysAgo;
});

// Social trending: Last 48 hours only
const twoDaysAgo = new Date();
twoDaysAgo.setDate(twoDaysAgo.getDate() - 2);
```

This ensures users only see current, relevant content.

### Challenge 3: Caching Strategy

**Problem:** Fetching from 38 RSS feeds takes 6-10 seconds. Too slow for every page load.

**Solution:** Multi-layer caching:
1. **Database cache:** Save fetched articles to Supabase
2. **Reddit cache:** 2-hour TTL for social data
3. **Client-side:** Next.js handles page caching

Result: Most loads complete in under 2 seconds.

### Challenge 4: Next.js 15 Params Handling

**Problem:** Next.js 15 changed how dynamic route params work - they're now async.

**Solution:** Update all dynamic routes:
```typescript
// Old (Next.js 14):
export async function GET(req, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;
}

// New (Next.js 15):
export async function GET(req, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params;  // Must await
}
```

I updated all `[id]` routes to handle this correctly.

## 11. Integration Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Generic AI Content

**Problem:** When generating newsletter drafts, the AI was writing about genetics and random topics instead of AI news.

**Root Cause:** My prompts were too generic. I was just saying "write a newsletter introduction" without specifying the topic.

**Solution:** I made prompts mode-aware and explicit:
```typescript
const prompt = `
NOW WRITE A NEWSLETTER INTRODUCTION FOR AN AI NEWS NEWSLETTER:

Content Focus: AI news, machine learning, and artificial intelligence developments

Topics to mention: ${topTopics.join(', ')}

IMPORTANT: This is an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE newsletter, 
so focus ONLY on AI news. Do NOT write about genetics unless 
it's one of today's topics.
`;
```

This dramatically improved content relevance.

### Challenge: Draft Authentication

**Problem:** Users were getting 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to view or approve drafts.

**Root Cause:** My API routes were only checking the Authorization header, but the JWT token was in an httpOnly cookie.

**Solution:** I created a helper function used across all draft endpoints:
```typescript
async function getUserFromToken(request: NextRequest) {
  // Try header first
  let token = request.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  
  // Fallback to cookie (the actual location)
  if (!token) {
    token = request.cookies.get('auth-token')?.value;
  }
  
  // Verify JWT
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWT_SECRET);
  return { id: payload.userId, email: payload.email };
}
```

This fixed all authentication issues immediately.

## 20. Lessons Learned

Building this taught me valuable lessons:

**Technical Lessons:**
1. Prompts matter MORE than model choice. Specific, detailed prompts beat generic ones every time.
2. Caching is essential for good UX. Multi-layer caching made the platform feel instant.
3. Error handling must be graceful. Users should see helpful messages, not stack traces.
4. Type safety saves time. TypeScript caught dozens of bugs before runtime.

**Product Lessons:**
1. Start with the problem, not the solution. Understanding user pain points led to better features.
2. Metrics prove value. The ROI calculator turns abstract benefits into concrete numbers.
3. User experience matters. Beautiful design + fast performance = happy users.
4. Iteration is key. I fixed bugs and improved features based on testing.

**Development Lessons:**
1. Documentation as you go. Writing docs during development saved time later.
2. Test early and often. Catching auth issues early prevented major headaches.
3. Use proven tools. shadcn/ui, Supabase, and Groq were excellent choices.
4. Git commit frequently. Clear commit messages made debugging easier.
