## ⚠️ Voice Training Still Failing?

**Error:** "Failed to save voice profile"

**Reason:** Missing Supabase Service Role Key

---

## 🔑 Quick Fix (2 steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Settings** (⚙️) → **API**
4. Scroll down to **Project API keys**
5. Find **`service_role`** key
6. Click **👁️ Reveal** to show the key
7. **Copy** the entire key (starts with `eyJhbGc...`)

**Important:** This is NOT the anon key. It's the secret `service_role` key below it.

---

### Step 2: Add to Environment File

**Open terminal and run:**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/New-Assigmnet-10-9-25/creatorpulse

# Open .env.local in editor
nano .env.local
```

**Scroll to the bottom** and add this line:

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=paste_your_copied_key_here
```

**Save:** Press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`

---

### Step 3: Restart Server

```bash
# Kill any running servers
pkill -9 -f "next dev"

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

**Wait for:** "Ready on http://localhost:3000"

---

## ✅ Then Test Voice Training

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/voice-training
2. Make sure you're **logged in**
3. Copy samples from `training.md`
4. Paste into textarea
5. Click "Upload & Train"
6. Should work now! ✅

---

## 🔍 Why This is Needed

**The Problem:**
- New tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- RLS checks `auth.uid()` from Supabase Auth
- But we use JWT cookies, not Supabase Auth
- Service role key bypasses RLS (server-side only)

**The Solution:**
- Service role key allows server-side database access
- Still secure because we validate user_id from JWT first
- Only server code can use it (never exposed to browser)

## 📋 Checklist

- [x] Database migration run ✅
- [x] Tables created ✅
- [ ] Service role key added to .env.local ← **DO THIS**
- [ ] Server restarted ← **THEN THIS**
- [ ] Voice training tested ← **THEN TEST**

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Check browser console (F12):
- Look for specific error messages
- Share the exact error with me

### Check server terminal:
- Look for error logs when you upload
- Error messages will show what's failing

### Common issues:
- Not logged in → Login first
- Service key wrong → Double-check copied correctly
- Server not restarted → Must restart after env changes

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You need:**
1. Supabase service role key in `.env.local`
2. Server restart
3. Then try voice training again

**That's it! This will fix the "Failed to save voice profile" error!** 🚀

---

**Quick commands:**

```bash
# Add service key to .env.local
nano /Users/jaan/Desktop/New-Assigmnet-10-9-25/creatorpulse/.env.local
# Add: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key_here

# Restart server
pkill -9 -f "next dev"
cd /Users/jaan/Desktop/New-Assigmnet-10-9-25/creatorpulse
npm run dev
```
