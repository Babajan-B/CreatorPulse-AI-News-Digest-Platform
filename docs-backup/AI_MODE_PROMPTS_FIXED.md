# ‚úÖ AI Mode Prompts Fixed - No More Genetics Content!

## üêõ Problem Identified

When generating newsletter drafts for **AI news**, the introduction and closing were mentioning **genetics** and other irrelevant topics instead of focusing on **AI, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**.

**Example Issue:**
```
Introduction: "Today we're exploring exciting breakthroughs in genetics..."
Closing: "Next week, more on molecular biology..."

‚ùå Wrong topic! Should be about AI!
```

---

## üîç Root Cause

### Issue 1: Generic Prompts
The LLM prompts didn't specify **what type of newsletter** this was:
```typescript
// Old prompt (too generic):
"Write a newsletter introduction..."
"Write a closing..."
```

**Result:** LLM generates about random topics (genetics, physics, etc.)

### Issue 2: No Mode Context
The voice matcher functions didn't know if this was:
- AI News newsletter, OR  
- Science Breakthrough newsletter

### Issue 3: Missing Mode Parameter
The `mode` wasn't passed through the call chain:
```
API ‚Üí Draft Generator ‚Üí Voice Matcher
(mode lost along the way)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Mode-Specific Prompts
**File:** `lib/voice-matcher.ts`

**Introduction Prompt (Updated):**
```typescript
NOW WRITE A NEWSLETTER INTRODUCTION FOR AN AI NEWS NEWSLETTER:

Content Focus: AI news, machine learning, and artificial intelligence developments

Write about:
- AI developments and exciting breakthroughs
- Topics like: GPT models, LLMs, AI startups, machine learning
- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE newsletter content ONLY

IMPORTANT: This is an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE newsletter, 
so focus ONLY on AI news, machine learning, and artificial intelligence developments. 
Do NOT write about genetics unless it's one of today's topics.
```

**Closing Prompt (Updated):**
```typescript
NOW WRITE A NEWSLETTER CLOSING FOR AN AI NEWS NEWSLETTER:

Content Focus: AI news and developments

Write closing for:
- AI news updates
- Tease more AI news and developments in next edition

IMPORTANT: Stay on topic about AI news and developments. 
Do NOT mention genetics or other topics unless they were featured in today's articles.
```

**Commentary Prompt (Updated):**
```typescript
NOW WRITE A BRIEF COMMENTARY FOR THIS AI NEWS ARTICLE:

Focus on: AI and machine learning developments and their impact on technology, business, or society

Explain why this AI development matters
Connect to broader themes in AI and technology

IMPORTANT: Focus on AI and machine learning developments. Stay on topic.
```

### Fix 2: Mode Parameter Added
**File:** `lib/draft-generator.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Added `mode` parameter to `generateDraft()` options
2. Default mode: `'ai_news'`
3. Pass mode to all voice matcher calls
4. Mode-specific default topics
5. Mode-specific title

**Code:**
```typescript
async generateDraft(userId, options: {
  mode?: 'ai_news' | 'science_breakthrough'  // ‚úÖ Added
}) {
  const mode = options.mode || 'ai_news';
  
  // Mode-specific defaults
  const defaultTopics = mode === 'ai_news' 
    ? ['GPT Models', 'LLMs', 'AI Startups', 'Machine Learning']
    : ['Medical Research', 'Physics', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology'];
  
  // Pass mode to voice matcher
  await matcher.generateIntro(profile, samples, {
    ...context,
    mode  // ‚úÖ Now includes mode
  });
  
  await matcher.generateClosing(profile, samples, {
    ...context,
    mode  // ‚úÖ Now includes mode
  });
}
```

---

### Fix 3: API Gets User Mode
**File:** `app/api/drafts/route.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Get user's preferred mode from settings
const { data: settings } = await supabaseClient
  .from('user_settings')
  .select('preferred_mode')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();

const userMode = settings?.preferred_mode || 'ai_news';

// Pass to generator
const result = await generator.generateDraft(user.id, {
  ...options,
  mode: userMode  // ‚úÖ User's preference
});
```
