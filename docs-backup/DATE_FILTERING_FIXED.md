# ✅ Date Filtering Fixed - Current Content Only

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### Problem 1: News Articles Showing 2-Month-Old Content
**Before:** Articles from any time period were displayed
**Impact:** Users seeing outdated AI news, not current developments

### Problem 2: Social Media Trending Showing Old Posts  
**Before:** Trending topics included posts from weeks/months ago
**Impact:** Not truly "trending" - missing current discussions

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **RSS Articles - 7-Day Filter** 
**File:** `lib/rss-parser.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// ADDED: Filter to only last 7 days
const sevenDaysAgo = new Date();
sevenDaysAgo.setDate(sevenDaysAgo.getDate() - 7);

const recentArticles = allArticles.filter(article => {
  const publishedDate = new Date(article.publishedAt);
  return publishedDate >= sevenDaysAgo;
});
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Only articles from **last 7 days** shown
- ✅ Automatic filtering before sorting
- ✅ Console logs show: "Filtered to X articles from last 7 days"

---

### 2. **Social Media Trending - 48-Hour Filter**
**File:** `lib/social-media-service.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// ADDED: Filter to only last 48 hours
const twoDaysAgo = new Date();
twoDaysAgo.setDate(twoDaysAgo.getDate() - 2);

const filterRecent = (posts: SocialMediaPost[]) => {
  return posts.filter(post => {
    const postDate = new Date(post.created_at);
    return postDate >= twoDaysAgo;
  });
};
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Reddit posts
- ✅ Hacker News posts
- ✅ Lobsters posts
- ✅ Slashdot posts
- ✅ Product Hunt posts

**Result:**
- ✅ Only posts from **last 48 hours** shown
- ✅ Truly current trending topics
- ✅ Console logs show filtering stats per platform

---

### 3. **Reddit Cache - 2-Hour Refresh**
**File:** `lib/reddit-cache.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// CHANGED: From 12 hours to 2 hours
private updateInterval = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 2 hours for fresh trending
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Cache refreshes every **2 hours** instead of 12
- ✅ More frequent updates for trending content
- ✅ Better real-time trending detection

## 🔍 How to Verify

### 1. Check News Articles
```bash
# Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
# Look at article publish dates
# Should see: "2 hours ago", "1 day ago", "5 days ago"
# Should NOT see: "2 months ago", "45 days ago"
```

### 2. Check Social Trending
```bash
# Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
# Scroll to "AI Trending on Social Media"
# Should see recent posts (hours/1-2 days old)
# Should NOT see posts from weeks ago
```

### 3. Check Server Logs
```bash
# Watch for these logs:
📅 Filtered to X articles from last 7 days (from Y total)
📅 Filtered to last 48 hours:
   Reddit: 16/20
   Hacker News: 18/20
   etc.
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Date comparison
const cutoffDate = new Date();
cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - X); // X days ago

const filtered = items.filter(item => {
  const itemDate = new Date(item.date_field);
  return itemDate >= cutoffDate; // Only if newer than cutoff
});
```

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal:** Filtering is O(n), happens after fetch
- **Better UX:** Smaller result sets load faster
- **Accurate:** No false trending topics
